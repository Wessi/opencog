RelEx2Logic Scripts
===================

This folder contains Scheme functions for converting RelEx relations into OpenCog representation that is
better suited for automated reasoning by PLN and other tools. Details on how to use this RelEx2Logic
pipeline can be found at [Running Relex2Logic with OpenCog](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Running_Relex2Logic_with_OpenCog) wiki page.

The final OpenCog representations are documented at [RelEx2Logic Representation](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/RelEx2Logic_representation) wiki page.
