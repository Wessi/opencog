/**
 * Evaluate an ImplicationLink embedded in a BindLink
 *
 * Given a BindLink containing variable declarations and an
 * ImplicationLink, this method will "evaluate" the implication,
 * matching
 * the predicate, and creating a grounded implicand, assuming the
 * predicate can be satisfied. Thus, for example, given the structure
 *
 *    BindLink
 *       ListLink
 *          VariableNode "$var0"
 *          VariableNode "$var1"
 *       ImplicationLink
 *          AndList
 *             etc ...
 *
 * Evaluation proceeds as decribed in the "do_imply()" function below.
 * The whole point of the BindLink is to do nothing more than
 * to indicate the bindings of the variables, and (optionally) limit
 * the types of acceptable groundings for the variables.
